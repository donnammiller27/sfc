# SEPTA Rail Fare Calculator Interactive Fare Purchase Widget
  (jquery plugin)


When you take regional rail in and out of the city, the fare price
is affected by where you purchase the ticket, when you ride, and how
far you travel. 

You can learn more about the details on 
[SEPTA's website](http://www.septa.org/fares/ticket/index.html)
The information is compiled into this [JSON file](fares.json). 

When you change any input information, the fare is automatically recalculated.

To use the widget:

  In your html:  
  
    `<link href="css/septafc.css" rel="stylesheet">`		

  To set the widget:
    `<div id="septafc"></div>`
    
  
  Before the `</body>` tag:
    You need to load jquery
             and
    `<script src="js/septafc.js"></script>`     

    
  In your javascript on ready: 

  $.('#septafc').septaFareCalculator();
